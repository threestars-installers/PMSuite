# PMSuite
All PMSuite costumes/sprites for PMSuite Installer builds.

The PMSuite Installer PenguinMod project pulls from this repository's .pms files to add the PMSuite sprites, and then delete the installer sprite.
The PMSuite Installer is a one-time installer PenguinMod project (.pmp file) to install PMSuite on an empty project with ease.
